Java
1. Maintainable
2. Readable
3. Write once run anywhere -WORA - platform independant
4. handle exceptions
5. Collection API concepts.
6. Secure
7. Robust
OOP - objects has properties and behaviours.
Java is not 100% obje oriented bcz of primitive data type.
Functional programming was introduced in JAVA 8. and it is a stable version
Variable: Value can be changed at any time, and a container to hold data

An operating system (OS) is the main software that manages all the hardware 
and software on a computer or device. It acts as a bridge between you, the applications, and the computer’s hardware.

Linux -> open source, Security ,stability and reliability( so most of the servers, cloud applications are based on linux).
Docker, Git, K8's - all are based on linux.

Unix based -MacOS
Unix like - Android,LInux, Ubuntu

OS has 2 parts : Kernal(kernel is the core part of the operating system and handles the process) and shell (The shell is a
 user interface that allows you to interact with the operating system.
It takes your commands, sends them to the kernel, and displays the result.)

Windows -> Shell like , (CMD, powershell)

CMD commands:
creating a new file: touch filename  (by default it is .txt)
for listing the filenames: ls
to edit file : vi filename -> click on i to insert -> type data -> for saving press esc ->the type :wq and enter
:w -> save only 
:q --> exit only.
:q! -> quit without saving.
:x  --> save and exit
to view the data inside the file : cat filename
clear: to clear the screen.
present working directory : pwd
to copy from one file to another : cp file1 file2
rename file : mv file1 file2
delete file: rm filename
delete folder: rmdir folder
delete folder including files in it: rm -r folder

ls -l
permissions   memory owner grp-of-owner  size file-created/deleted filename
ls -a  -> shows all files including hidden
 
absolute path -> address from the root directory
relative path -> from the current directory

wc filename  -> word count
no_of_lines   no_of_words   bytes  filename

to find a word inside a file: grep word filename
grep "word" file1 file2  -> multiple files
grep "word" *      -> in the whole directory
grep -w "word" filename   -> search the whole word.

to view data in sorted order  -> sort file1
sort -r file1

permissions: owner  group  others  
r- read
w- write
x- execute

giving permissions : chmod permission_code file1

0-> no permission
1-> execute
2-> write
4-> read

eg: chmod 700 myfile.txt


while creating an object , when we use new keyword, it allocates memory while running JVM. 

Instance variable -> declared inside an instance , can be accessed by the methods inside the class
Local variable: declared inside a method and the scope is within the method only.

Constructor:
1. method used to initialize the variables in a object
2. doesnot return a value
3. same name as class
4. automatically it is called.
5. If constructor is absent, java will create a constructor by default.

2 types constructor: default and parameterised. if we give parameterised array, we need to define default constructor also.

Arrays: Single and multidimensional.
